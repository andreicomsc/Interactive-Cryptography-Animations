# Interactive Cryptography Animations
This project is a web-based educational tool that visually demonstrates the "BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol" using interactive animations. Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application leverages the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library to create smooth, intuitive animations that explain the steps of quantum key exchange in an engaging and accessible way.

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of both, quantum cryptography principles, and front-end development techniques. Through this work, I gained valuable skills in designing interactive educational content, structuring clear and modular JavaScript code, and using GSAP to build complex timeline-based animations. I also developed a stronger ability to communicate abstract technical concepts through visual storytelling and user experience design.

This project enhanced my proficiency in: JavaScript and DOM manipulation, animation sequencing with GSAP, translating theoretical cryptographic protocols into intuitive visual formats, and creating responsive and visually engaging interfaces for technical education.
